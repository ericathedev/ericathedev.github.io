As software engineers, the machines we write code on becomes an extension of our identity. Whilst with desktop machines there are many ways to make your setup unique, with laptops, your options are a little more limited. And that is why many developers turn to stickers to make their machines unique. Here are _the 5 Kinds of Laptop Owners - Sticker edition_:

# 1. The #NoStickers club

![Laptop without stickers](/assets/2020-03-31-laptop-stickers/ek1mzzf9c8nzmlrs7vmh.jpg)

This person has no stickers on their laptop. 

This person is either:
- a remotee who doesn't get to see other engineers IRL very often
- someone who exclusively works with people who stick stickers on their laptop
- someone who will one day open their laptop only to find they've swiped their colleague's machine by mistake

# 2. The Minimalist

This person has only a few stickers on their laptop, typically one sticker covering the logo.

This person either:
- doesn't believe in a lot of worldly possessions
- very restrained
- runs some kind of YouTube show where their laptop is on video, and they think that by covering the logo we can't tell what brand of laptop they own
- has recently gotten a new laptop and needs to get their sticker game on

# 3. The Classic Laptop Owner

This person has a laptop with the standard number of stickers on it. The stickers do not overlap, and have been curated over time. 

This person either:
- enjoys the aesthetics of a nicely decorated laptop
- is a goody two shoes who conforms to social norms

# 4. The Overlapping Stickerer

The great debate - what do you do when you run out of room for new stickers? Do you stop sticking stickers on your laptop, your masterpiece complete? Or do you start _overlapping the stickers_ ðŸ˜±.

This person either:
- is in need of a new laptop!
- is a conference speaker who receives too many stickers
- someone who cannot be bothered to remove old stickers when they fade away and replace them with new ones

Either way, you can tell this person's history through the layers of stickers, like the layers of an ancient archaeological excavation site. 

# 5. The One with the Laptop Stickers INSIDE their Laptop

You thought we were done? You are so wrong... there is one more type of laptop owner, and this is the strangest one of them all... The One with the Laptop Stickers _inside_ their Laptop. These people are a rare breed, but they do exist.

This person either:
- uses their laptop as a desktop, always in a dock, never actually using their keyboard
- thinks out of the box

_So the question is... What kind of laptop owner are you? ðŸ˜„_
